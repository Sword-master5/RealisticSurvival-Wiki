## Prerequisites
To install Realistic Survival, you will need a Spigot or Paper Server (most preferably the latest version).<br>
Forks of either of these should work too, though we only test against Paper and Spigot.

### Realistic Survival 4 Downloads
You can download stable released builds on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/realistic-survival-1-17-temperature-thirst-baubles.93795/history) or download development builds in the `dev-log` channel of the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mMt3f4usqK).
Stable builds have been around for quite a while and were thoroughly tested, development builds are the latest builds of Realistic Survival you can get.
If your Server is very reliant on a working build of Realistic Survival, choose a stable build.
But if you want to help contribute to Realistic Survival by reporting issues and helping us identify those more quickly, please consider using a development build (Bug Reports from "stable" builds may be ignored since they are outdated).

**We generally recommend development builds over stable builds, as they are the most recent versions of Realistic Survival. The stable branch is only updated once a month or even less frequent, so fixes may take quite a while to make it into these builds.**

## How to install
Drag and drop the Realistic Survival jar file into your server's */plugins/* directory.
Then, restart your server.<br>
***Do not use /reload, as it can cause intense memory leaks.***
